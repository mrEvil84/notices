Require vs Include

Typically the require() statement operates like include() .
The only difference is â€” the include() statement will only generate a PHP warning but allow script execution to continue
if the file to be included can't be found,
whereas the require() statement will generate a fatal error and stops the script execution.


Require vs Require_once

The require_once() statement is identical to require()
except PHP will check if the file has already been included,
and if so, not include (require) it again.
